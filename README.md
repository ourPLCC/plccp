# plccp

(EXPERIMENTAL) PLCC for Python


---

# Devlopers

## GitPod

We use GitPod.io to provide ephemeral development environments for this project.

## Install PLCC into dev environment.

This installs the current PLCC, not PLCCP.

```bash
bin/install-plcc.sh
```

Open a new terminal. Now plcc commands (e.g., plccmk, scan, parse, rep).

You'll need to run this each time you start a GitPod workspace if you
need plcc commands in that workspace.
